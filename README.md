scrypt-filter
=============

An attempt to modify scrypt to be able to behave as a filter, and also to take
a password from an environment variable (unsafe, but useful in a pipe).

scrypt is a part of tarsnap and created and copyrighted by Collin Percival. I'm
just an idiot with a git repository. As I have never programmed before, feel
free to contact me if you see something to fix or improve.
